_Nepotic, despotic lunatics of homeric proportions got nuttin' on me..._

We all have our inner Caligulas<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>; this repo lays mine bare.

Enter to find unbridled meglomania, which, thanks to the mass reprogramming DJT™ has inflicted on our collective souls, seems to be all the rage.

## _No, but really, what is this_?
Circa Nov.2016, the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) Package Manager makes my blood boil.  This repo aims to provide a (potentially broke and overly baroque) mechanism to safeguard against the bitrot of my creations(...to come; currently they only exist as `.figments` in my lil' ol' noggin')

This is achieved, in part, through reckless disfigurement and subversion of such Julia gems as Conda.jl, IJulia.jl, and many others. (Clones only: [1](https://github.com/lilinjn/Conda.jl),[2](https://github.com/lilinjn/IJulia.jl) --- no source repos have been harmed!)

## _What's in it for you?..._
... not much, I'm afraid. But you are welcome to take as you like, all the same!
