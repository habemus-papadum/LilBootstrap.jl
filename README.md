------------------------

We all have our inner [Caligulas](https://www.google.com/search?q=caligula+little+boots); this repo lays mine bare.

Enter to find unbridled meglomania, which, thanks to the mass reprogramming DJT has inflicted on our collective souls, seems all the rage.

## _No, but really, what is this_?
Circa Nov.2016, the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) Package Manager makes my blood pressure rise.  This repo aims to provide an (overly baroque) mechanism to safeguard against bitrot  of my many masterpieces (to come... currently they only exist as `.figments` in my tiny brain.)

This is achieved, in part, through reckless disfigurement and subversion of such Julia gems as Conda.jl, IJulia.jl, and many others. (Clones Only: [1](https://github.com/lilinjn/Conda.jl),[2](https://github.com/lilinjn/IJulia.jl) --- no real repos have been harmed!)

## _What's in it for you?..._
... not much, I'm afraid. But you are welcome to take as you like, all the same!
